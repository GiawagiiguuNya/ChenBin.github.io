## openEDS:
this dataset is captured by HMD. And is used for [/ Semantic Segmentation challenge]   and [/ Synthetic Eye Generation challenge]
it has accurate annotation but no 3D GV

Used for _Gaze Prediction Challenge_, _Sparse Semantic Segmentation Challenge_

 __Gaze Prediction Challenge__ calls for 
Predicting future gaze locations based on the previously estimated gaze vectors while additionally leveraging spatio-temporal information encoded in sequence of previously recorded eye-images.

 __Sparse Temporal Semantic Segmentation Challenge__ 
main goal: use Spatiotemporal context  of video to complete accurate eye segmentation.
some method:

1. Temporal co-segmentation using deep learning
2. Temporal few-shot learning framework
3. Learning and respecting the natural representation, including the geometry, of human eyes for temporal label propagation
4. Leveraging synthetic data generation if and where appropriate (such as UnityEyes, NVGaze)

This dataset include 3D GV given by video. and of course, segmentation label..
